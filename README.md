Slashing is a concept that is unique to the Ice project, and it sets us apart from other crypto projects. Unlike other projects, which often reward miners simply for contributing computational power, Ice rewards only those users who are active and engaged with the community.

The idea behind this is that a strong and active community is essential for the success of any decentralized network. In the case of Ice, we believe that the users who deserve to be rewarded are those who contribute to the growth and success of the network. This could include inviting friends to join the network, participating in discussions, or otherwise helping to build trust and engagement within the community.

On the other hand, users who are inactive or do not support the network may have their coins slashed for inactivity. This means that they will lose a portion of their balance as a penalty for not participating in the network.

At Ice, we believe that this approach is fair and ensures that only those users who truly deserve to be rewarded are able to earn free digital currency. By rewarding active and engaged members of the community, we are able to foster a sense of trust and collaboration that is essential for the success of the network.

Users who are not actively supporting the network (daily check-in by tapping on the Ice logo button), will gradually lose coins through progressive slashing.



The Ice community is based on trust and engagement!

If the user becomes inactive and does not tap on the Ice logo button to initiate a new mining session, he will start losing gradually coins from his balance.

During the first 30 days of inactivity, the user will lose all the coins that were earned in the last 30 days of activity.



The loss will be prorated hourly.

Starting from the 31st day until the 60th day of inactivity, the user will lose the remaining coins in the balance.



Of course, if the user initiates a new check-in (mining) session during this period and chooses to benefit from the resurrection option, all the lost coins will be restored to the balance.

If the user does not enter the application for 2 months, he will lose all the coins earned and resurrection will not be available anymore
